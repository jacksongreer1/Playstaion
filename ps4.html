        <h1>The next milestone is now the PlayStation 4, also known as the PS4. The PS4 so far has been Sony's biggest success ever. The PS4 was launched on November 15, 2013, in North America, November 29, 2013 in Europe, South America and Australia, and on February 22, 2014 in Japan. This was the first time a Sony console was released in the United States first. It had  aAMD Accelerated Processing Unit. The PS4 places an increased emphasis on social interaction and integration with other devices and services, including the ability to play games off-console on PlayStation Vita and other supported devices with remote-play, which is where you can play a game through a friend without even buying it or having it downloaded on your console. The PS4's controller was also redesigned and improved with improved buttons and analog sticks and an integrated touchpad among other changes, where you could for example draw on the controller. The PS4 also was the first console to support 4-K resolution. It was also the first console to have a storage for one terabyte, with the cost of the more expensive version in the PS4 Pro. Sony also continues the streak, with making a smaller version in the PS4 Slim. The PS4 also introduced the start of making virtual reality games. It also started a way that you can live stream directly from your own console with ways to set up cameras. The PS4 was arguably one of the biggest successes if not the biggest in the gaming console industry with its new milestones and innovations. </h1>
