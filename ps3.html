The PS3 is known to be one of the lesser innovated consoles  within Sony's history making them.

The PS3 Vita was also created, which was the first handheld version of a console ,which would inspire the Nintendo Switch and Wii U. This PlayStation also had a slim that was much lighter. The PS3 didn't live up to the hype as of the other two previous consoles, but it still had some major milestones that play a part in the gaming industry. Sony still was saving the best. </h1>
