        <h1>Sony later upgraded from the original PlayStation. On March 4, 2000 Sony released a brand new product in the PlayStation 2 and it would later come to the United States on October 26 of that same year. The PlayStation 2 reached new milestone with significant upgrades from the original one. The PlayStation 2 (known as the PS2) changed the gaming industry forever at that time. The PS2 had the introduction of a device that came built in with a DVD and CD player. This was a major game changer, because you were buying a video game console and a DVD and CD player, which at the time were expensive .The PS2 helped drive the DVD format. It also offered internet connectivity and online gameplay for the very first time on any gaming device. The PS2 also had inspired the introduction of motion technology like with the Sony EyeToy. The PS2's design also was improved majorly. Sony later came out with a PS2 slim, which was a smaller version of the console , but it was way more compatible. It had RenderWare design software. It made it much easier for developers to make games for the PS2â€™s complex system architecture. The PS2 also had third party support, which lead to more games. It also came with backwards compatibility, so you can still play original PlayStation games. The PS2 also had the DualShock controller, which made you feel vibration in the controller while you were playing a game. The PS2 helped revolutionize the gaming industry, but Sony was far from done. </h1>
