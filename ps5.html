        <h1>The next and current milestone is in the current generation in the PlayStation 5, also known as the PS5. The PS5 is still relatively new, so they're still many innovations and milestones to come, but it has already set many milestones for the gaming and console industry.The PS5 was released on November 12, 2020, in Australia, Japan, New Zealand, North America, and South Korea, with worldwide release following a week later. It's in the ninth generation of video games. The base model includes an optical disc drive compatible with Ultra HD Blu-ray discs. The PS5 has a digital only version for it. This is the first time ever a gaming console has ever had a no disk console. It was very popular among customers with the price being cheaper. The PS5's main hardware features include a solid-state drive customized for high-speed data streaming to enable significant improvements in storage performance. PS5 is also the first gaming system to be entirely 4k with the proper setup on your television, monitor, etc. The innovations are so nice ,that there have been a shortage of parts to use to construct the design of the console, so that there is a current redesign going on. This also moves from the DualShock controller, which has been used since the PS2, but now with a DualSense with more vibration and sound coming from the controller.  A built in microphone is also in the controller. The PS5 is just getting started with a newer version already planning to come out. This is what Sony has got to with the many milestones of PlayStations but they're much more to come. </h1>
