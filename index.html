    <h4>The <i>PlayStation</i> has had many different milestones over the year. It was made December 3, 1994. Sony also modernized a controller pattern by introducing a new system called the Dual Analog Controller. This was the first modern gamepad thanks to the innovation of two analog sticks. This allowed for greater camera control in action and platforming games, and it also made shooters much easier to play on consoles. The PlayStation was built with highly powerful hardware to support its 3D gaming requirements. It introduced photorealistic 3D gaming and gameplay never before seen in other consoles. The PlayStation was very revolutionary to gaming. The PlayStation was introduced to the United States at the Electronic Entertainment Expo n Los Angeles in May 1995. They pre-sold over 100,000 units by September's US launch. Within a year, they had sold almost two million units in the United States and over seven million worldwide. They reached the milestone of 100 million units by the end of 2003.The console was a slim, gray unit and the PSX joypad allowed far more control than the controllers of the Sega Saturn competitor. It sold more than 300,000 units in the first month of sales in Japan. It was even more revolutionary in other countries. The PlayStation took gaming out of the '80s arcade style as it introduced photorealistic 3D gaming and gameplay never before seen in other consoles. It had no storage on it, but it only had a memory card. This was just the beginning for The PlayStation.</h4>

      <h4 class="PS2">Sony later upgraded from the original PlayStation. On March 4, 2000 Sony released a brand new product in the <i>PlayStation 2</i> and it would later come to the United States on October 26 of that same year. The PlayStation 2 reached new milestone with significant upgrades from the original one. The PlayStation 2 (known as the <i></i>) changed the gaming industry forever at that time. The PS2 had the introduction of a device that came built in with a DVD and CD player. This was a major game changer, because you were buying a video game console and a DVD and CD player, which at the time were expensive .The PS2 helped drive the DVD format. It also offered internet connectivity and online gameplay for the very first time on any gaming device. The PS2 also had inspired the introduction of motion technology like with the Sony EyeToy. The PS2's design also was improved majorly. Sony later came out with a PS2 slim, which was a smaller version of the console , but it was way more compatible. It had RenderWare design software. It made it much easier for developers to make games for the PS2â€™s complex system architecture. The PS2 also had third party support, which lead to more games. It also came with backwards compatibility, so you can still play original PlayStation games. The PS2 also had the DualShock controller, which made you feel vibration in the controller while you were playing a game. The PS2 helped revolutionize the gaming industry, but Sony was far from done. </h4>

    <h4     class="PS3">The next milestone for Sony's PlayStation is the <i>PlayStation 3</i>, which is known as the PS3. It was released in Japan on November 11, 2006 and then released to the United States only 6 days later that same year. This was also a major revolutionizer for the gaming industry. The PS3 started the usage of the Cell microprocessor, which is made up of one 3.2 GHz PowerPC-based Power Processing Element and six accessible Synergistic Processing Elements. The PS3 is known to be one of the lesser innovated consoles  within Sony's history making them. It was really hard competing withe the new XBOX 360, but the PS3 still had some really cool milestones and innovated features. The console was the first PlayStation to integrate social gaming services with PlayStation Plus, which  is a paid subscription service from PlayStation which gives members two  games to download every month, as well as access to online multiplayer gaming, exclusive discounts from PlayStation Store. It also gives you 100 gb of extra. storage.  It was also the first console to use Blu-ray Disk technology as its primary storage medium. The PS3 Vita was also created, which was the first handheld version of a console ,which would inspire the Nintendo Switch and Wii U. This PlayStation also had a slim that was much lighter. The PS3 didn't live up to the hype as of the other two previous consoles, but it still had some major milestones that play a part in the gaming industry. Sony still was saving the best. </h4>

    <h4 class="PS4" >The next milestone is the <i>PlayStation 4</i>, also known as the PS4. The PS4 so far has been Sony's biggest success ever. The PS4 was launched on November 15, 2013, in North America, November 29, 2013 in Europe, South America and Australia, and on February 22, 2014 in Japan. This was the first time a Sony console was released in the United States first. It had  aAMD Accelerated Processing Unit. The PS4 places an increased emphasis on social interaction and integration with other devices and services, including the ability to play games off-console on PlayStation Vita and other supported devices with remote-play, which is where you can play a game through a friend without even buying it or having it downloaded on your console. The PS4's controller was also redesigned and improved with improved buttons and analog sticks and an integrated touchpad among other changes, where you could for example draw on the controller. The PS4 also was the first console to support 4-K resolution. It was also the first console to have a storage for one terabyte, with the cost of the more expensive version in the PS4 Pro. Sony also continues the streak, with making a smaller version in the PS4 Slim. The PS4 also introduced the start of making virtual reality games. It also started a way that you can live stream directly from your own console with ways to set up cameras. The PS4 was arguably one of the biggest successes if not the biggest in the gaming console industry with its new milestones and innovations. </h4>

    <h4 class="PS5">The next and current milestone is in the current generation in the <i>PlayStation 5</i>, also known as the PS5. The PS5 is still relatively new, so they're still many innovations and milestones to come, but it has already set many milestones for the gaming and console industry.The PS5 was released on November 12, 2020, in Australia, Japan, New Zealand, North America, and South Korea, with worldwide release following a week later. It's in the ninth generation of video games. The base model includes an optical disc drive compatible with Ultra HD Blu-ray discs. The PS5 has a digital only version for it. This is the first time ever a gaming console has ever had a no disk console. It was very popular among customers with the price being cheaper. The PS5's main hardware features include a solid-state drive customized for high-speed data streaming to enable significant improvements in storage performance. PS5 is also the first gaming system to be entirely 4k with the proper setup on your television, monitor, etc. The innovations are so nice ,that there have been a shortage of parts to use to construct the design of the console, so that there is a current redesign going on. This also moves from the DualShock controller, which has been used since the PS2, but now with a DualSense with more vibration and sound coming from the controller.  A built in microphone is also in the controller. The PS5 is just getting started with a newer version already planning to come out. This is what Sony has got to with the many milestones of PlayStations but they're much more to come. </h4>
