    <h4>The PlayStation has had many different milestones over the year. It was made December 3, 1994. Sony also modernized a controller pattern by introducing a new system called the Dual Analog Controller. This was the first modern gamepad thanks to the innovation of two analog sticks. This allowed for greater camera control in action and platforming games, and it also made shooters much easier to play on consoles. The PlayStation was built with highly powerful hardware to support its 3D gaming requirements. It introduced photorealistic 3D gaming and gameplay never before seen in other consoles. The PlayStation was very revolutionary to gaming. The PlayStation was introduced to the United States at the Electronic Entertainment Expo n Los Angeles in May 1995. They pre-sold over 100,000 units by September's US launch. Within a year, they had sold almost two million units in the United States and over seven million worldwide. They reached the milestone of 100 million units by the end of 2003.The console was a slim, gray unit and the PSX joypad allowed far more control than the controllers of the Sega Saturn competitor. It sold more than 300,000 units in the first month of sales in Japan. It was even more revolutionary in other countries. The PlayStation took gaming out of the '80s arcade style as it introduced photorealistic 3D gaming and gameplay never before seen in other consoles. It had no storage on it, but it only had a memory card. This was just the beginning for The PlayStation.

   <h4>Sony later upgraded from the original PlayStation. On March 4, 2000 Sony released a brand new product in the PlayStation 2 and it would later come to the United States on October 26 of that same year. The PlayStation 2 reached new milestone with significant upgrades from the original one. The PlayStation 2 (known as the PS2) changed the gaming industry forever at that time. The PS2 had the introduction of a device that came built in with a DVD and CD player. This was a major game changer, because you were buying a video game console and a DVD and CD player, which at the time were expensive .The PS2 helped drive the DVD format. It also offered internet connectivity and online gameplay for the very first time on any gaming device. The PS2 also had inspired the introduction of motion technology like with the Sony EyeToy. The PS2's design also was improved majorly. Sony later came out with a PS2 slim, which was a smaller version of the console , but it was way more compatible. It had RenderWare design software. It made it much easier for developers to make games for the PS2â€™s complex system architecture. The PS2 also had third party support, which lead to more games. It also came with backwards compatibility, so you can still play original PlayStation games. The PS2 also had the DualShock controller, which made you feel vibration in the controller while you were playing a game. The PS2 helped revolutionize the gaming industry, but Sony was far from done. </h4>
