        <h1> The PlayStation has had many different milestones over the year. It was made December 3, 1994. Sony also modernized a controller pattern by introducing a new system called the Dual Analog Controller. This was the first modern gamepad thanks to the innovation of two analog sticks. This allowed for greater camera control in action and platforming games, and it also made shooters much easier to play on consoles. The PlayStation was built with highly powerful hardware to support its 3D gaming requirements. It introduced photorealistic 3D gaming and gameplay never before seen in other consoles. The PlayStation was very revolutionary to gaming. The PlayStation was introduced to the United States at the Electronic Entertainment Expo n Los Angeles in May 1995. They pre-sold over 100,000 units by September's US launch. Within a year, they had sold almost two million units in the United States and over seven million worldwide. They reached the milestone of 100 million units by the end of 2003.The console was a slim, gray unit and the PSX joypad allowed far more control than the controllers of the Sega Saturn competitor. It sold more than 300,000 units in the first month of sales in Japan. It was even more revolutionary in other countries. The PlayStation took gaming out of the '80s arcade style as it introduced photorealistic 3D gaming and gameplay never before seen in other consoles. It had no storage on it, but it only had a memory card. This was just the beginning for The PlayStation.</h1>
